# Knights Fitness Tracker
Created for CIS 4004 Web-Based IT.

Our project is hosted on the web using the service InfinityFree, so the only step that is necessary to access it is clicking on the link in the right sidebar, which directs you to [cisfitnessapp.ct.ws](cisfitnessapp.ct.ws).

AI usage citation: ChatGPT was used for technical guidance on the development of our project. We used the following prompts:

1. "How to fetch and display weather data using an API" to build the weather feature on our homepage
2. "How to create a dropdown menu using HTML and CSS" to design the dropdown menu on our login screen
